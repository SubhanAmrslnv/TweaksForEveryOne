; Window spectacle FX - one-shot takeovers of the whole desktop.
;
; Function definitions and global initialisers only, no top-level statements.
; This module opens and closes bare #HotIf around the five bindings it carries.
;
; Gravity close, curtain drop, carousel Alt-Tab, black-hole delete, black-hole
; minimize and shatter-to-close are grouped because they behave the same way:
; each fires once, seizes a large part of the screen, and has to put everything
; back. Their hotkeys live HERE rather than in InputBindings.ahk because in each
; case the binding body IS the feature.
;
; EACH BINDING IS GATED IN ITS #HotIf CRITERIA, NOT BY RE-SENDING THE KEY FROM
; THE BODY. With the feature off the key is simply not claimed, so Windows own
; behaviour runs - Alt+F4 closes, Win+D shows the desktop, Alt+Tab is the normal
; switcher. CLAUDE.md lists Win+D and Alt+Tab as deliberately not touched, and
; this is what keeps that true.
;
; WHEN SWAPPING A REAL WINDOW FOR A BITMAP COPY, SHOW THE COPY BEFORE HIDING THE
; ORIGINAL, or there is a frame with neither on screen.
;
; Bye() calls RestoreCurtain() and RestoreShatters(). CurtainWindows is the ONLY
; record of where those windows came from, so exiting mid-effect without it
; leaves the desktop swept clean with no way back.
;
; A Gui object must outlive its animation: pass the OBJECT into the closure and
; finish with Destroy(), never WinClose. These effects create dozens of Guis per
; invocation, so a leak here is immediate rather than gradual.

; Behind its flag rather than re-sending Alt+F4 from the body: with the
; feature off the key is simply not claimed, so Windows' own close runs and
; nothing sits in front of Alt+F4 at all.
